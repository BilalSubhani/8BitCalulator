# 8-Bit Calculator using 8051 Microcontroller

This project implements an 8-bit calculator using the 8051 microcontroller, designed to perform elementary math operations and base conversions. It utilizes assembly language programming on Keil software and is simulated using Proteus. The calculator supports operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two 8-bit numbers entered via a 4x3 keypad. Additionally, it offers conversions between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal bases. Results are displayed on a 16x2 LCD screen. For detailed implementation and operational details, please refer to the [wiki](wiki) section.

## Features

- **Elementary Math Operations:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using designated opcodes (`#*`, `##`, `**`, `*#`).
  
- **Base Conversion:** Convert numbers between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal bases using opcodes (`**`, `*#`, `#`).
